## Code of conduct for a safe working environment
- Each member should contribute equally and positively to the group.
- Team member‚Äôs will offer respectful suggestions and feedback on one‚Äôs work before the due date. Also, no team member should delete someone else‚Äôs working before talking with the group and that member.
- Every team member‚Äôs opinion will be thoughtfully considered and agreed upon by the whole group.
- All team members will speak respectfully to each other and will not talk down to each other. 
- Team members will listen to one‚Äôs idea without interrupting or discussing it first.
- If a team member has a conflict with another member, they should contact that person immediately and discuss it before moving on.
- Attend important team meetings or inform team members if unable to attend.
- Weekly meetings will be held via Discord to discuss the project and other progress that has been made. 
- A Google Doc will be made for each meeting to record the following vital points.
   
    - Project progress
   
    - Timeline update
   
    - Project issues/resolutions 

- The workload for the project will be evenly distributed among each member of the team.
    - The grade of B or better is the ultimate goal of the team.
- All arrangements will be made to ensure each student has a stable workload that would not interfere with other course work.
- Work should be completed in a timely manner and should be held to the exception of what is being asked of them.
- If a team member is interested in a specific aspect of the project that has been assigned to another team member, the two team members may trade tasks. 
   - Should this happen, the team members must let the rest of the members know when they have done so and what their new responsibility is.
 - All decisions concerning the team and the overall project must be agreed on unanimously. 
   - If the team is unable to agree, the UNCC faculty in charge ( Dr. Mejias)  will be contacted to help settle the issue. 
 - All conflicts should be settled between the team members involved. 
   - Should the members be unable to settle things between themselves, the UNCC faculty in charge ( Dr. Mejias) should be consulted immediately. 
 - At this time, the team has chosen not to elect a team leader.
 - Should a member of the team fall behind on their assigned task, they should alert the team ASAP so that adjustments can be made to compensate for the delay. 
 - Should any member of the team continually (2 or more times) fail to meet deadlines without communicating beforehand with the team, that team member will be removed from the project. 
   - The UNCC faculty in charge ( Dr. Mejias) will be made aware of this decision.
